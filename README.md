# Advanced Lab
NYUAD Advanced Physics Laboratory Spring 2021 relevant files. In this repository we present the complete collection of resources related to the experiments we conducted in PHYS-UH3013. Specifically all the raw and processed data, as well as the analysis scripts are available to download and edit. Here we also provide high resolution figures of the images found in the text of the reports and more.
