- Pictures of the Setup
- Lab notebook entries

## Contents
1. **[Lab-Data](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab/tree/main/2.Interferometry/1.Lab-Data)**  
  Contains all the Raw data collected with the apparatus as well as analysis scripts

## Notes
In data analysis each directory contains a list of csv files that correspond to the raw data and are named accordignly to specify the differences between them. Also we have included an iPython analysis notebook in each to process and understand the data.
