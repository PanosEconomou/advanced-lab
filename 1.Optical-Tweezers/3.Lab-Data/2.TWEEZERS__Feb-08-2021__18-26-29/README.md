# Optical Tweezers | LAB DATA | PSD Analysis V1 *Cancelled*
**[Back to LAB DATA](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab/tree/main/1.Optical-Tweezers/3.Lab-Data)**

**[Return to Main](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab)**

## Overview
**DISCLAIMER: This section has been removed from our official analysis**. This section contains the data and analysis for the Power spectrum density. In that process we trapped a bead and measured the brownian motion around it. 

## Contents
1. [Analysis](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab/blob/main/1.Optical-Tweezers/3.Lab-Data/2.TWEEZERS__Feb-08-2021__18-26-29/1.ANALYSIS.ipynb)

## Data Naming protocol
1. **Raw Data:** TRP\<height\>\_\<trial number\>\.csv
2. **Image Data:** TRP<height\>.tiff

## Notes
In data analysis each directory contains a list of csv files that correspond to the raw data and are named accordignly to specify the differences between them. Also we have included an iPython analysis notebook in each to process and understand the data.
