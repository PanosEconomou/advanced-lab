## Overview
This section contains the data and analysis for the Stage Position Calibration. In that process we moved the stage by a set voltage and then, moved it back with the micrometer knobs in order to convert the voltage appleid to displacement in micrometers

## Data Naming protocol
Data is contained in the analysis file

## Notes
In data analysis each directory contains a list of csv files that correspond to the raw data and are named accordignly to specify the differences between them. Also we have included an iPython analysis notebook in each to process and understand the data.
