# Optical Tweezers | LAB DATA | QPD Calibration *Cancelled*
**[Back to LAB DATA](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab/tree/main/1.Optical-Tweezers/3.Lab-Data)**

**[Return to Main](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab)**

## Overview
**DISCLAIMER: This section has been removed from our official analysis**. This section contains the data and analysis for the Power spectrum density. In that process we moved the stage with a stuck bead in a traingle wave in both x and y and we recorded to QPD output to find the relationship between the stage voltage and the QPD voltage.

## Data Naming protocol
1. **Raw Data:** QPD-CAL\<Light Intensity in mA\>\.csv

## Notes
In data analysis each directory contains a list of csv files that correspond to the raw data and are named accordignly to specify the differences between them. Also we have included an iPython analysis notebook in each to process and understand the data.
