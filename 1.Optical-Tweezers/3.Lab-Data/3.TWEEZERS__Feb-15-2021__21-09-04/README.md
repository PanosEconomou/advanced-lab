## Overview
This section contains the data and analysis for the trapping methodology. In that process we moved the stage in the x-axis back and fourth in a sawtooth manner in order to determine if the bead was in close to the cover slip in the z-axis.

## Contents
1. [Analysis](https://github.com/PanosEconomou/advanced-lab/blob/main/1.Optical-Tweezers/3.Lab-Data/3.TWEEZERS__Feb-15-2021__21-09-04/1.ANALYSIS.ipynb)

## Data Naming protocol
1. **Raw Data:** TRP_<height in μm>_<Laser Power in mA>.csv
2. **Image Data:** TRP_<height in μm>.tiff

## Notes
In data analysis each directory contains a list of csv files that correspond to the raw data and are named accordignly to specify the differences between them. Also we have included an iPython analysis notebook in each to process and understand the data.
