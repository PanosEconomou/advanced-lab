## Overview
This section contains the data and analysis for the Drag Force Calibration. In that process we moved the stage in a triangle wave in the x axis with a stuck bead at various trap stifnesses in order to find the trap stiffness as a function of light intensity.

## Data Naming protocol
1. **Raw Data:** TRP_Drag_\<AXIS\>\_\<Laser Intensity in mA\>\_\<Frequency in Hz\>\_\<Amplitude in V\>\.csv


## Notes
In data analysis each directory contains a list of csv files that correspond to the raw data and are named accordignly to specify the differences between them. Also we have included an iPython analysis notebook in each to process and understand the data.
